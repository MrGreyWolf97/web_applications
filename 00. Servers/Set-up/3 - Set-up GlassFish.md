The GlassFish project provides a structured process for developing the GlassFish Server platform that makes the new features of the Java EE platform available faster, while maintaining the most important feature of Java EE: **compatibility**.

It enables Java developers to access the GlassFish Server source code and to contribute to the development of the GlassFish Server.

The GlassFish project is designed to encourage communication between Oracle engineers and the community.
