The [OmniFaces](http://omnifaces.org) project has a component `<o:resourceInclude>` for this.

> The component can be used to catch the output from a JSP or Servlet resource and render it as output to the JSF writer. In effect, this allows you to include both Servlets and JSP pages in e.g. Facelets.

You can use it as follows:

```xml
<o:resourceInclude path="/someJSPpage.jsp" />
```

See the showcase with example [here](http://showcase.omnifaces.org/components/resourceInclude).
