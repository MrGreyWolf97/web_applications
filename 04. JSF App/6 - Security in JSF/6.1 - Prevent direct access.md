> [!question] Stop user from direct-accessing pages
>   I am using these files for a login system:

>   - **index1.xhtml**  
>   - **index2.xhtml**
>   - **error.xhtml**
>   
>   **Login** is my default page.
>   I want the user to access **index1.xhtml** and **index2** ONLY once they have logged in from **login** page.
>   Currently, my login system is working but user can directly come to these other pages by typing the direct url.
