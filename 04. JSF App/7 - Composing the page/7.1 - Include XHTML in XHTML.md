Most basic way is [`<ui:include>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/javaserver-faces-2-2/vdldocs-facelets/ui/include.html).
The included content must be placed inside [`<ui:composition>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/javaserver-faces-2-2/vdldocs-facelets/ui/composition.html).

Kickoff example of the master page `/page.xhtml`:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:ui="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets">
    <h:head>
        <title>Include demo</title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        <h1>Master page</h1>
        <p>Master page blah blah lorem ipsum</p>
        <ui:include src="/WEB-INF/include.xhtml" />
    </h:body>
</html>
```

The include page `/WEB-INF/include.xhtml` (yes, this is the file in its entirety, any tags outside `<ui:composition>` are unnecessary as they are ignored by Facelets anyway):

```xml
<ui:composition 
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:ui="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets">
    <h2>Include page</h2>
    <p>Include page blah blah lorem ipsum</p>
</ui:composition>
  
```

This needs to be opened by `/page.xhtml`. Do note that you don't need to repeat `<html>`, `<h:head>` and `<h:body>` inside the include file as that would otherwise result in [invalid HTML](http://validator.w3.org).

## `<ui:define>`/`<ui:insert>`

A more advanced way of including is _templating_. This includes basically the other way round. The master template page should use [`<ui:insert>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/javaserver-faces-2-2/vdldocs-facelets/ui/insert.html) to declare places to insert defined template content. The template client page which is using the master template page should use [`<ui:define>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/javaserver-faces-2-2/vdldocs-facelets/ui/define.html) to define the template content which is to be inserted.

Master template page `/WEB-INF/template.xhtml` (as a design hint: the header, menu and footer can in turn even be `<ui:include>` files):

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:ui="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets">
    <h:head>
        <title><ui:insert name="title">Default title</ui:insert></title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        <div id="header">Header</div>
        <div id="menu">Menu</div>
        <div id="content"><ui:insert name="content">Default content</ui:insert></div>
        <div id="footer">Footer</div>
    </h:body>
</html>
```

Template client page `/page.xhtml` (note the `template` attribute; also here, this is the file in its entirety):

```xml
<ui:composition template="/WEB-INF/template.xhtml"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"
    xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
    xmlns:ui="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets">

    <ui:define name="title">
        New page title here
    </ui:define>

    <ui:define name="content">
        <h1>New content here</h1>
        <p>Blah blah</p>
    </ui:define>
</ui:composition>
```

This needs to be opened by `/page.xhtml`. If there is no `<ui:define>`, then the default content inside `<ui:insert>` will be displayed instead, if any.

## `<ui:param>`

You can pass parameters to `<ui:include>` or `<ui:composition template>` by [`<ui:param>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/javaserver-faces-2-2/vdldocs-facelets/ui/param.html).

```xml
<ui:include ...>
    <ui:param name="foo" value="#{bean.foo}" />
</ui:include>
```

```xml
<ui:composition template="...">
    <ui:param name="foo" value="#{bean.foo}" />
    ...
</ui:composition >
```

Inside the include/template file, it'll be available as `#{foo}`. In case you need to pass "many" parameters to `<ui:include>`, then you'd better consider registering the include file as a tagfile, so that you can ultimately use it like so `<my:tagname foo="#{bean.foo}">`. See also [When to use <ui:include>, tag files, composite components and/or custom components?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6822000)

You can even pass whole beans, methods and parameters via `<ui:param>`. See also [JSF 2: how to pass an action including an argument to be invoked to a Facelets sub view (using ui:include and ui:param)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8004233/jsf-2-how-to-pass-an-action-including-an-argument-to-be-invoked-to-a-facelets-s)

## Design hints

The files which aren't supposed to be publicly accessible by just entering/guessing its URL, need to be placed in `/WEB-INF` folder, like as the include file and the template file in above example. See also [Which XHTML files do I need to put in /WEB-INF and which not?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9031811)

There doesn't need to be any markup (HTML code) outside `<ui:composition>` and `<ui:define>`. You can put any, but they will be **ignored** by Facelets. Putting markup in there is only useful for web designers. See also [Is there a way to run a JSF page without building the whole project?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10504190)

The HTML5 doctype is the recommended doctype these days, "in spite of" that it's a XHTML file. You should see XHTML as a language which allows you to produce HTML output using a XML based tool. See also [Is it possible to use JSF+Facelets with HTML 4/5?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2935759/is-it-possible-to-use-jsffacelets-with-html-4-5) and [JavaServer Faces 2.2 and HTML5 support, why is XHTML still being used](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19189372/javaserver-faces-2-2-and-html5-support-why-is-xhtml-still-being-used).

CSS/JS/image files can be included as dynamically relocatable/localized/versioned resources. See also [How to reference CSS / JS / image resource in Facelets template?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8367421/how-to-reference-css-js-image-resource-in-facelets-template)

You can put Facelets files in a reusable JAR file. See also [Structure for multiple JSF projects with shared code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8320486).
