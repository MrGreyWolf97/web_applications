### ID Attributes
JSF appends the form's ID to all input fields inside the form.
Hence, you need to be careful with your jQuery selectors.

For example, suppose you have the following form:

> [!success] Using jQuery, you have to refer to the input as: `$("#myForm\\:myInput")`
> ```javascript
><h:form id="myForm">
>   <h:inputText id="myInput" />
></h:form>
>```

### Frameworks
Some frameworks such as PrimeFaces, use components that may not work or may lost their skinning if you import your jQuery with:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.7.1.js"></script>
```

Instead, you should use their built-in jQuery library by importing as:

```javascript
<h:outputScript library="primefaces" name="jquery/jquery.js" target="head" />
```

> [!success] This jQuery library is, however, included in conflict mode which means you cannot use `$()`. Hence, you may need this additional setting:
> ```javascript
> <h:outputScript target="head">
>    $ = jQuery;
>    // Then you can use it
>    $(document).ready(function() {
>        ...
>    });
> </h:outputScript>
> ```
