# Introduction

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications.

It is also an MVC web framework that simplifies the construction of User Interface (UI) for server-based applications by using reusable UI components in a page. 

JSF was developed by the Java Community Process (JCP), a community of organizations and individuals who guide the evolution of Java technologies. The development of JSF started in 2001 and the first release was in 2004 as JSF 1.0. It was created to simplify the development of user interfaces for Java EE applications. 

Over the years, JSF has gone through several updates:

JSF 1.1 (2004): This was a maintenance release to fix several bugs in the 1.0 version.
JSF 1.2 (2006): This release aligned JSF with JSP 2.1 and made it part of the Java EE 5 platform.
JSF 2.0 (2009): This was a major release that introduced many new features like Ajax support, a new view description language called Facelets, and improved support for web application development.
JSF 2.1 (2010): This was a minor release with a few new features and bug fixes.
JSF 2.2 (2013): This release added HTML5 support, improved security features, and introduced the concept of "flows" to represent a user's interaction with a web application.
JSF 2.3 (2017): This is the latest release and it further improves on JSF by adding more Ajax functionality, better integration with CDI, and a whole host of other improvements.

As of now, JSF is a mature and stable framework used by many organizations around the world. However, it's worth noting that while JSF is still in use, it's not as popular as some other modern web frameworks like Spring MVC, due to its complexity and steep learning curve.
