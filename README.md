# Web Applications DIY

This project consists in a set of Chapters, each one correspondint to an Obsidian vault.

The final goal of this project is not to deliver a complete guide to create a Web Application (even if some chapters are particularly detailed), but to:
1. show the main differences between the possible implementations
2. show the evolution of the solutions found during the years
3. give a list of pros and cons, describing the most fitting cases for each solution
4. answering common questions about the topic

In the end, it contains a good amount of knowledge quite essential for every Mid/Senior Software Engineer to properly do their job.
