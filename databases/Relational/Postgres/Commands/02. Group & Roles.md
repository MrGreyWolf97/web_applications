Previous versions of Postgres, and some other DB systems, have separate concepts of:
- "==groups==" => are granted access to database objects
- "==users==" => can login, and are members of one or more groups.

In modern versions of Postgres, the two concepts have been merged: 
- "==role==" => can have the ability to login, the ability to "inherit" from other roles (like a user being a member of a group, or a group being a member of another group), and access to database objects.

For convenience, many tools and manuals refer to any user with login permission as a "user" or "login role", and any without as a "group" or "group role", since it is useful and common practice to keep roughly to that structure.

> [!info] ALIASES
> This is entirely a convention of terminology, and to understand the permissions, you need only understand the options available when [creating roles](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/sql-createrole.html) and [granting them access](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/sql-grant.html).
> 
> Again purely for convenience, Postgres still accepts commands using the old terminology, such as [`CREATE USER`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html) and [`CREATE GROUP`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-creategroup.html) which are both aliases for [`CREATE ROLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

If you write `CREATE USER`, the `LOGIN` permission will be added to the new role by default, to emulate the old behaviour when that was a separate command.
