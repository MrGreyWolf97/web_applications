[Object Relational Mapping](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/object-relational-mapping-ORM#:~:text=Object%2Drelational%20mapping%20(ORM)%20is%20a%20way%20to%20align,language%20and%20a%20relational%20database.) (ORM) in simple terms is mapping our application objects to tables in our database using object-oriented programming.

We achieve interaction with our various relational databases using ORM, to fetch or retrieve our information ==without writing native SQL==.

The vast majority of Java-based or any applications hosted on the internet need either the developers or the end-users to perform database operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting a large amount of data.

We can all agree that performing these database operations can sometimes be very tedious.

As you can see from the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) library, it requires writing a lot of boilerplate lines of code.

So to minimize or lessen the burden of writing these codes to interact with the database, Java-enabled tools called [Hibernate](https://www.javatpoint.com/hibernate-tutorial) and [Java Persistence API](https://www.javatpoint.com/jpa-introduction) (JPA) have been provided as industrial standardized options, which can be substituted in place of JDBC or writing native SQL syntax to interact with our databases.
