One of the greatest advantages of **JavaServer Faces** technology is that it offers a clean separation between behavior and presentation for web applications.

A JSF App can map:
1. **HTTP requests to component-specific event handling**
2. **Manage components as stateful objects on the server**

JSF allows you to build web applications that implement the ==finer-grained separation of behavior and presentation== that is traditionally offered by client-side UI architectures.

The *separation of logic from presentation* also allows each member of a web application development team to focus on a single piece of the development process and provides a simple programming model to link the pieces.

Page authors with no programming expertise can use JSF technology tags in a web page to link to server-side objects without writing any scripts.

> [!tip]
> JSF technology APIs are layered directly on top of the Servlet API.
> 
> This layering of APIs enables several important application use cases, such as:
> 1. using different presentation technologies
> 2. creating your own custom components directly from the component classes
> 3. generating output for various client devices.

## Advantages

Facelets technology offers several advantages.
- Code can be reused and extended for components through the templating and composite component features.
- You can use ==***annotations***== to automatically register the managed bean as a resource available for JSF applications.
  In addition, implicit ==***navigation rules***== allow developers to quickly configure page navigation (see [Navigation Model](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jsf-intro005.htm#BNAQL) for details).
  These features reduce the manual configuration process for applications.
- Most important, JavaServer Faces technology provides a rich architecture for managing component state, processing component data, validating user input, and handling events.
