**FacesServlet** is a servlet that manages the request processing lifecycle for web applications that are utilizing JavaServer Faces to construct the user interface.

> [!list] ServletContainerInitializer
> If the application is running in a ==Servlet== 3.0 (and beyond) ==container==, the runtime must provide an implementation of the [`ServletContainerInitializer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee%2F7%2Fapi%2F%2F/javax/servlet/ServletContainerInitializer.html "interface in javax.servlet") interface that declares the following classes in its [`HandlesTypes`](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee%2F7%2Fapi%2F%2F/javax/servlet/annotation/HandlesTypes.html "annotation in javax.servlet.annotation") annotation.

### URL Mapping
This servlet must be *==automatically mapped==* if: 
1. it is **not** explicitly mapped in `web.xml` or `web-fragment.xml`
2. one or more of the following conditions are true.
	- A `faces-config.xml` file is found in `WEB-INF`
	- A `faces-config.xml` file is found in the `META-INF` directory of a jar in the application's classpath.
	- A filename ending in `.faces-config.xml` is found in the `META-INF` directory of a jar in the application's classpath.
	- The `javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES` context param is declared in `web.xml` or `web-fragment.xml`.
	- The `Set` of classes passed to the `onStartup()` method of the `ServletContainerInitializer` implementation is not empty.

> [!success] Automatically mapping
> If the runtime determines that the servlet must be *automatically mapped*, it must be mapped to the following `<url-pattern>` entries.
> - `/faces`
> - `*.jsf`
> - `*.faces`

This class must be annotated with `javax.servlet.annotation.MultipartConfig`.
This causes the Servlet container in which the JSF implementation is running to correctly handle multipart form data.

### Some security considerations relating to this class

The topic of web application security is a cross-cutting concern and every aspect of the specification address it.
However, as with any framework, the application developer needs to pay careful attention to security.
Please consider these topics among the rest of the security concerns for the application. This is by no means a complete list of security concerns, and is no substitute for a thorough application level security review.

##### Prevent access to view source
If the `FacesServlet` is mapped using a prefix `<url-pattern>`, such as `<url-pattern>/faces/*</url-pattern>`, something must be done to prevent access to the view source without its first being processed by the `FacesServlet`.
One common approach is to apply a `<security-constraint>` to all *Facelets files* and flow definition files.

> [!tip]
> Please see the **Deployment Descriptor** chapter of the Java Servlet Specification for more information the use of `<security-constraint>`.

##### Restricting HTTP Methods
The JSF specification only requires the use of the GET and POST http methods.
If your web application does not require any other http methods, such as PUT and DELETE, please consider restricting the allowable http methods using:
- `<http-method>`
- `<http-method-omission>`

> [!tip]
> Please see the **Security** of the Java Servlet Specification for more information the use of these elements.
